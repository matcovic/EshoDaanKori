I was able to see Erika and Aaron this past weekend (distanced of course!) and they asked me to post this on their behalf.\n\n“Aaron and I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for the generous donations. Your gift has helped us to hire a full time helper for the kids while I have had to return to work. We also hired someone to help us get the house ready to list, what a huge help that was! We can’t thank you enough for your generous gifts. We are beyond grateful and touched.”",
